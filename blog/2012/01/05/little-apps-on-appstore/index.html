Little apps on the Mac AppStore

Published on: Jan 5, 2012 @ 0:28 Edit

I just published two little apps on the Mac AppStore. Both were successfully validated, and are available for purchase.

<a href="http://www.noxeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/autopurge.png"><img class="alignright img-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-image-517" style="margin-bottom: 100px;" title="autopurge" src="http://www.noxeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/autopurge-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>

The first one, named «<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autopurge/id480739949?mt=12">AutoPurge</a>» is a UI agent, placed in the menu bar, that automatically frees unused memory based on a specific user-defined time interval.
It's useful for Macs with low memory capabilities, or for users that use a lot of huge programs, like VMWare, Adobe Creative Suite, Xcode, etc.

Mac OS X doesn't always reclaim the used memory immediately, when a program exits. So if you use a lot of software, your Mac may become slow, as the system will then have to use the hard disk as memory, when all the physical RAM is used.

AutoPurge helps the system to recover the unused memory, making it available again to applications.

AutoPurge is available for $0.99, from the Mac AppStore:
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autopurge/id480739949?mt=12"> http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autopurge/id480739949?mt=12</a>

The second one, called «<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sostatus/id490656622?mt=12">SOStatus</a>», provides you with real-time informations from your <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> account, from the menu bar.

It's available for $0.99 too, from the Mac AppStore:
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sostatus/id490656622?mt=12"> http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sostatus/id490656622?mt=12</a>
