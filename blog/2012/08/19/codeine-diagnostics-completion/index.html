Codeine - Diagnostics & Code completion

Published on: Aug 19, 2012 @ 20:55

Since I <a href="http://www.noxeos.com/2012/08/15/announcing-codeine/">announced</a> Codeine, I mainly worked on live code diagnostics and code completion.

Live diagnostics are now working well.<br />
I modified Codeine's console area to provide live diagnostics, as well as the output console.<br />
The whole stuff now looks like this:

<a href="http://www.noxeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/debug.png"><img src="http://www.noxeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/debug.png" alt="" title="debug" width="600" height="95" class="img-thumbnail size-full wp-image-665" /></a>

On the right, you can select the output console, or the code diagnostics (here with a well formed code).

Diagnostics are provided in real-time:

<a href="http://www.noxeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/errors.png"><img src="http://www.noxeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/errors.png" alt="" title="errors" width="572" height="305" class="img-thumbnail size-full wp-image-668" /></a>

In that example, I didn't include the necessary C library headers, hence the errors.

Code completion is more complex, but it's now beginning to work:

<a href="http://www.noxeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/complete.png"><img src="http://www.noxeos.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/complete.png" alt="" title="complete" width="548" height="245" class="img-thumbnail size-full wp-image-670" /></a>

Code-completion results still needs to be filtered, and the final output will of course provide useful infos, just as xCode autocompletion.

So stay tuned. I'll keep posting here updates about Codeine. : )
