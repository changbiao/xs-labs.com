WebStart Light

Published on: Feb 14, 2011 @ 23:08

Today, I decided to create a light and free version of WebStart.

It will only include Apache 2, MySQL 5.1, and PHP 5.3.
Only one virtual host will be available by default (but you can still tweak the configuration files).

No log file viewing, no configuration editing, no OpenLDAP, no easy website creation and management, no SCM...
But it will be free. : )
