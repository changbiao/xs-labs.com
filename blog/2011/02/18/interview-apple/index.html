Interview with Apple

Published on: Feb 18, 2011 @ 17:24

The interview is done!
Two hours, with a SpringBoard Apps manager, and a GameKit manager, writing C code on 
a sheet of paper.

Linked lists, hash tables, big O notation, search algorithms, bitwise operations... 
Everything on paper.
It's kinda hard! And I have to say I felt stupid some times...

But they said I did well. So I'll have to wait for an answer.
Whatever happens, it's already amazing that Apple contacted me, and wanted to interview me here in Barcelona.

Now I'll enjoy my stay here, till sunday, having champagne on my private deck in the hotel.
Cheers!
