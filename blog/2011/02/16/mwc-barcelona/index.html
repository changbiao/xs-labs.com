Tomorrow morning, I'll flight to Barcelona. I'll be there till sunday.
I don't know if I'll be able to attend the Mobile World Congress, but I'll try eventually.

On Friday, I've got a meeting with Apple. Job interview with 3 iOS engineers managers, plus a recruiter.
Cross your fingers! California is just past the sea... ; )
