Face Detection on iPhone

Published on: Apr 7, 2011 @ 15:50

I've just released a example iPhone app that uses OpenCV to do face recognition.

The <a href="https://github.com/macmade/OpenCV-iOS">OpenCV port</a> for iOS is available on GitHub, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/macmade/FaceDetect">example app</a>.

Enjoy!
