WebStart - What's next

Published on: Mar 10, 2011 @ 9:51

I'm currently working on the next release of WebStart.

I plan to integrate support for the DynDNS service. That's a feature of MAMP pro, and I was asked for such a feature.
It will be for version 1.1, free upgrade for those with a 1.0 license code.

Next steps will be support for the Trac SCM. I plan to add a GUI over the Trac installation script, so you'll be able to create Trac projects directly from WebStart.
