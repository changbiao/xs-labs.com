CPU 64Bits check

Published on: Mar 17, 2011 @ 18:26

I had to make a little Mac OS X application that check if the processor has a 64Bits instruction set or not.
I made that for <a href="http://www.eosgarden.com/en/products/webstart/">WebStart</a>, as it only run on 64Bits machines, so users can test their own processor before downloading and buying the software.

It's not a great deal, since there are <code>__x86_64__</code> and <code>__i386__</code> macros, but in case you need such an app, it's available on GitHub, released under the <a href="http://www.eosgarden.com/en/opensource/licenses/boost/">Boost license</a>.
Feel free to use it:

I also made the icon myself, which is available in 2000px. Also feel free to use it without copyright limitations if you need it!
Enjoy!
