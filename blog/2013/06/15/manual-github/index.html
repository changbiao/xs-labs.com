Manual on GitHub

Published on: Jul 15, 2013 @ 22:36

Back in the days, I released a Mac AppStore application called «Manual».<br />
It was a simple GUI front-end for the UNIX manual pages.

<a href="http://au.linkedin.com/in/martyturner">Marty Turner</a> contacted me on Twitter, because he wanted to know if the app was still available somewhere.
As it wasn't available anymore, he kindly proposed to maintain it.

So I put the whole project on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/macmade/Manual">https://github.com/macmade/Manual</a>), and gave hime write access.

I must say very pleased to see people getting interested in those «old» projects and wanting to maintain them.

Thanks Marty : )
