Iconic - A Photographic Tribute

Published on: Oct 20, 2013 @ 19:01

I received yesterday my copy of the «Iconic» book, by Jonathan Zufi.

As the title says, it's a «photographic tribute to Apple Innovation».
The book consists of beautiful pictures of Apple's hardware, from the Apple 1 to the latest Macs and iPhones/iPads.

It's really amazing.
The book is just gorgeous, and it's just an amazing work.

So just <a href="http://iconicbook.com/">check it out</a>, whether you're an iPhone addict, Apple fanboy, or computer nostalgic like me... ^^
And also check Jonathan Zufi's website, <a href="http://shrineofapple.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/">Shrine Of Apple</a>, with it's awesome collection of vintage Apple hardware.
